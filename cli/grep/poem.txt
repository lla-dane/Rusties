In the quiet of the night, stars aglow,
Whispers of the wind, soft and low.
Dreams take flight on moonbeam's grace,
Embracing the darkness, in a silent embrace.

Hope's a beacon, shining bright,
Guiding us through the darkest night.
With each new dawn, a chance to start,
A fresh chapter written, with an open heart.
